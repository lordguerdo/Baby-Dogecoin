Two, it remains to be seen if Baby Dogecoin can gather similar following as [Dogecoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin) or [Shiba Inu](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shiba-inu-could-dethrone-dogecoin-150501608.html).

## Baby Dogecoin Price Analysis - Why are Investors so Hyped About Baby Dogecoin?

Baby Dogecoin was able to reach another all-time high and this comes at a time where its fellow crypto currencies have struggled to find traction. Investors are starting to notice the support Baby Doge is getting and are willing to get in for a piece of the action.

Since Baby Dogecoin is built on the [Binance smart chain protocol](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684900933/Binance-Smart-Chain-Launches-Today), it does not offer any revolutionary change, rather it relies on its hyper-deflationary [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) to differentiate itself from other &quot;Altcoins&quot;.

Since the developers have announced their intentions of burning tokens worth $600,000 the value of Baby Dogecoin has gone up significantly. This is because burning will reduce the circulating supply Baby Dogecoins and making the crypto more valuable for holders. This makes it exceedingly difficult for most people to get in over their heads and start buying up huge amounts of Altcoins. When the value goes down, because there is so much competition out there for the same scarce supply of Doge Coin, the market will tend to close in on the trend and the investors who bought into the hype are the ones that suffer the most. So keep your capitalization in mind when you are looking into investing in any type of cytotechnology, especially when it is a newer protocol that has not had a significant amount of time to build up its capitalization.
